Compilation and installation of PopART requires that you first install Qt4, Marble 
(library version >= 0.17.0, part of KDE 4.12), and lp_solve 5.5.2. These are available as 
packages for most Linux distributions. Package names are given for some major Linux 
distributions below.

Debian/Ubuntu*:
libqt4-dev
libmarble-dev
lp-solve
liblpsolve55-dev

Fedora:
qt4-devel
lpsolve-devel
marble-devel

Arch:
qt
lpsolve
kdeedu-marble

Gentoo:
sci-mathematics/lpsolve
x11-libs/qt4-meta
kde-base/marble (if you're not running KDE, you might want to use -kde -plasma use flags)

If you're using a different distribution, or if any of these names are wrong, please
let me know: jessica.w.leigh@gmail.com

=========================================================================================
*For Debian or Ubuntu users, if you install lp-solve and liblpsolve55-dev using the apt
system, you'll need to modify the popart.pro project file before running qmake.
Look for the first line that reads:

LIBS += -llpsolve55 -lmarblewidget

Note that there are two lines like this, you want the first, NOT THE ONE THAT FOLLOWS
SHORTLY AFTER "macx{". Edit this line so that it reads instead:

LIBS += -L/usr/lib/lp_solve/ -llpsolve55 -lmarblewidget -ldl

Then add the following line after:

QMAKE_RPATHDIR += /usr/lib/lp_solve/

As far as I know, this only affects Debian/Ubuntu and probably other Debian-related
distributions. 
==========================================================================================

You can also download the sources for lp_solve from 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/lpsolve/files/lpsolve/ and Qt4 from 
http://qt-project.org/downloads, and compile and install them yourself. Marble is 
available from a Git repository, with download, compilation, and installation instructions 
given here: http://marble.kde.org/sources.php

Once you've installed these packages, you're ready to compile PopART. Normally this
involves running the command:

qmake && make

or maybe (for Arch users at least):
qmake-qt4 && make

However, if you've installed the lpsolve or Marble headers somewhere other than 
/usr/include/lpsolve and /usr/include/marble, you'll have to tell qmake where they are. 
You can do this by running the commands:

qmake -makefile LPSOLVEDIR=/path/to/lpsolve/lpsolve MARBLEDIR=/path/to/marble popart.pro
make

Note that the lpsolve path should probably end in "lpsolve", and the Marble path should end 
in "marble". For example, if your lpsolve headers are in /opt/headers/lpsolve, and your 
Marble headers are in /opt/headers/marble, you should use:

qmake -makefile LPSOLVEDIR=/opt/headers/lpsolve MARBLEDIR=/opt/headers/marble popart.pro

If this doesn't work, please email me (jessica.w.leigh@gmail.com) and I'll help you
sort it out.

If make completes without any errors, congratulations! You should now have a working
copy of PopART. Run it with:

./popart

Or copy it somewhere useful, like /usr/local/bin or /home/yourname/bin.
